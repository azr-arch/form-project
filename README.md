Advanced Form Building
This project is an advanced form for an event that connects over 1000 bars. The form allows visitors to input essential details such as their name and email, and select a sports bar in their region. The chosen sports bar will receive an email notification indicating that a specific customer is interested in making a booking.

How to use
Open the form and input your essential details such as your name and email.
Select the bar-data file from the project directory. This file contains the data for all participating bars, including their unique identifier, email, city, and state.
Choose your region from the dropdown menu. The form will filter the available bars based on the selected region.
Select a sports bar from the list of available bars in your region.
Submit the form.
After submitting the form, the chosen sports bar will receive an email notification indicating that you are interested in making a booking.
